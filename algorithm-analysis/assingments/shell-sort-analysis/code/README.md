This is the empirical tests for shell sort. And can be made executing just:

```bash
$ chmod +x .assignments.sh
$ ./assignments
```

This will generate the sample arrays with differentes size, starting in 2^10 to 2^20. With uniform distribution, normal distribution for 
repeated numbers in the array and 75% ordered array. 
The output of the executing will be a file with two columns, in the format:
`${arr_size}\\t${time_in_seconds}\\n`

Ready to be plotted in gnuplot
